# Welcome to the api-request-js package! 

### What's the point? 
API. The problem that both beginner and intermediate programmers face while using APIs is getting data. How do we get this data? <br>

With a quick google search, we are directed to resources that show us multiple ways of getting data from an endpoint. Using fetch or axios are popular options and the tutorials show us code. But there's a problem. <br>

It's too complex. <br>

While Python has a simple requests library that just requires a simple line like: <br>
```requests.get('https://w3schools.com')``` <br>
JavaScript is much much MUCH more complex. Why? <br>
The equivalent of a get request in JavaScript requires the understanding of async and await, as well as the learnign and understanding of these concepts. <br>

Also, how do we download images from an api url? 

### Introducing api-request-js
Literally one line to replace them all.
